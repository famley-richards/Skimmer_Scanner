The Skimmer Scanner is a free, open source app that detects common bluetooth based credit card skimmers predominantly found in gas pumps. The app scans for available bluetooth connections looking for a device starting with **HC-0**. If found, the app will attempt to connect using the default password of 1234. Once connected, the letter 'P' will be sent. If a response of 'M' then there is a very high likelihood there is a skimmer in theCreateBond bluetooth range of your phone (5 to 15 feet).

The app *does not* obtain or download data from a given skimmer nor does it report any information to local authorities.

Skimmer Scanner is free, open source, and currently available for Android available [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=skimmerscammer.skimmerscammer). Please help us make it better! We are not mobile app developers and can use all the help we can get. We very much need an iOS version. Thank you!
